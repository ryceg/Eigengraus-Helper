# Eigengraus Helper
 
This is a bot which handles the collation of random lists- it's used primarily as a way to generate lists for Eigengrau's Generator, a TTRPG generator. There are no doubt plenty of other uses for it, though, therefore it is being made open source.

If you wish it to be hosted on your own server, that is a $10/month Patron feature.
